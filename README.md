SeedDropControl

Are you tired of annoying amounts of seed drops? Maybe you have dozens of mods and every piece of grass you break drops seeds and clearing a small area of grass leaves your inventory full, or even lags your game out?
 

Well this mod is for you. You can reduce the drops from grass and tall grass by up to 99% or as little as 1% - and you can reduce the rate of wheat seed drops independent from all other drops from mods if you want to as well.
 

The Config file is simple, just edit the seeddropcontrol.toml and set the % out of default seed rates you want to drop, for wheat seeds and modded seeds, and launch game/server.
